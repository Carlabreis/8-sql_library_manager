This is an application for a local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data manually. The application I created provides a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, I built a web application that includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books. I was given HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. I implemented a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

This project provided a great opportunity to learn more and practice with the work of implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence, as well as leveraging helpful database related tools to view and interact with your database.

After completing this project, I am able to add true data persistence in my projects, and implement, modify, interact with and maintain my own local custom SQLite database.
